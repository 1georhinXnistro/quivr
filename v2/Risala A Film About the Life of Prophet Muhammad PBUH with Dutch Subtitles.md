The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score, composed by Maurice Jarre.

Risala, on the other hand, is a Hausa-language film made by Abubakar S. Shehu, a Nigerian filmmaker. The film is set in the past and follows the journey of Zakariyya, a young man who seeks forgiveness from a farm owner for stealing fruits with his friends. Along the way, he faces many trials and tribulations, but also meets a wealthy trader who gives him a bag of gold before dying. Zakariyya eventually reaches the farm owner, who tests his honesty and piety by asking him to marry his disabled daughter. Zakariyya agrees, but discovers that the daughter is actually very beautiful. The film is based on a story that resembles the history of Abu Hanifa, a famous Muslim scholar. [^1^]
